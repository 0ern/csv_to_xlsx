# .csv to .xlsx Windows conversion script

## Description
This is a simple script to automatically convert one .csv file in a folder to .xlsx with autocolumn width and Excel auto-start.

For correct execution, download the "_script.bat" and put it in a folder with only one .csv file. Then run the script.

## Known bug
The script now works well with comma separated .csv but not yet with semicolons. 

Any suggestions on how to fix this would be appreciated.
